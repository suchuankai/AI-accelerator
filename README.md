# AI-accelerator
This is a CNN Accelerator design for the NCKU AOC (Team 9) final project.  
  
In this project, we train a model for **Fashion MNIST**, then quantize it with PyTorch to achieve hardware acceleration using **8-bit weights**.  
In hardware design, we also consider the differences in scaling factors between different layers.
