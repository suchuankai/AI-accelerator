# No clock gating version

## Description

This is a simple test of dual port sram which generated by memory compiler.

## Notes

- Each data entry is 64 bits.
- This SRAM supports simultaneous read and write operations. In the program, A port is used for writing values obtained from tb, while B port is used to read values from SRAM memory.
- Because of memory size is mem[0:511][511:0], if simultaneous read and write operations are desired, addresses for read and write operations must differ by 8.  
  Otherwise, the read operation will take priority over the write operation.

## Instruction

```
ncverilog tb.v tb.v Top.v +access+r
ncverilog tb.v tb.v Top_syn.v tsmc13_neg.v +define+SDF +access+r
